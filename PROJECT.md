# DisciFlow - Life Operating System

## Project Overview
DisciFlow is a personal discipline and life-tracking web app that acts as a "Life Operating System". The goal is to track entire life in a structured, data-driven way — daily, monthly, and yearly.

## Core Philosophy
- **Discipline over motivation** - Build systems that don't rely on fleeting motivation
- **Consistency over intensity** - Small daily actions compound into massive results
- **Data-driven self-improvement** - Let the numbers guide your growth
- **Simple, clean, scalable system** - Start simple, scale intelligently
- **Built first for personal daily use, later scalable to SaaS**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 (latest)
- **Bridge**: Inertia.js 2.0.17
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
